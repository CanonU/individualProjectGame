A stage based reaction game with increasing difficulty Until you fail.

### Project Objective
My goal for this project is to create a game that gets more and more complicated the further you get. Starting off you will just have to avoid circles moving in a straight line. Then after a certain point I will add targets on the screen so you have to avoid the circles while hitting the targets. Then I will add math questions that you answer by typing in the answer. Overall there will be increasingly more difficult challenges stacking on top of each other unil you eventually fail.
