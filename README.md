### Project Objective
My goal for this project is to create a reaction based game where you avoid circles. As the game progresses the amount of circles will increase. I am hoping to add a leveling system with experience "orbs" that appear around the screen that increase your xp and at the level up, you unlock various skills that can increase your chance of survival.
